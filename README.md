This is the repository for my personal website.
It'll typically have a lot of muck, mostly commented out code/html and so on.
So if you think this code is a pile of stinky doo doo, you're probably right.
Send in a pull request or raise an issue pointing to the offending code and 
I'll clean it up. Other feedback always welcome.

Attribution
-----------

This website took me some amount of effort and a couple of iterations to
design and come up with. If you use the source code, attribution would be nice.
